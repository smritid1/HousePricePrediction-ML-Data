# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a dataset of housing features. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models to generate accurate predictions. 

The project is designed for anyone interested in real estate analytics, data science, or machine learning.

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizes key trends and relationships in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² to assess model performance.
